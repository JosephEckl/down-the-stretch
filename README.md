# down-the-stretch

This is a site that I created myself during my co-op at MoDuet using only free tools. 
The client runs a radio show about thoroughbred handicapping and sells betting sheets for his audience.
Unfortunately, the client split ways with the MoDuet soon after the site went live.
MoDuet doesn't have a backup of the site, so I pulled these screenshots.
The site is live at downthestretch.net, but the live version isn't entirely representative of the original.
The home page screenshot was pulled from the wayback machine went it went live originally. The rest of the pages are live.
